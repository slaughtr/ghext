    <string name="help_text_editor">The editor is fairly straightforward. Just type the things you want to send to Pastebin in the big ol\' text field, then hit the Pastebin button to open a menu with options for sending your text to Pastebin. \nYou can also use the Cut/Copy/Paste buttons at the bottom of the screen to...cut, copy, and paste things. \nLong-pressing on the Paste button will bring up a list of the last few things you've cut or copied inside the editor. Clicking one of these will paste it into the editor at the current cursor position!\nAlso, if you have some text inside the editor and you back out to the main screen, when you go back the text should still be there! Great for note taking!</string>
    <string name="help_text_general">While you don\'t NEED a Pastebin account to use this app, most features won\'t work unless you login. \nWithout logging in, you can still submit new pastes and see the list of trending pastes. \nWhen logged in, you can see all of your own pastes and have many more options when submitting a paste.</string>
    <string name="help_text_pastebin">Pastebin is a text sharing service. It allows you to share small and large bits of text with others. You can define syntax highlighting (for sharing code), expiration times, and privacy. \nIt\'s incredibly useful when you just want to send a bit of code or a list of information to someone, or make notes for yourself that are available from anywhere with an internet connection.</string>
